## Contributing
To buid and contribute you will need these libraries, for general advice with making stardew valley mods I recommend looking on the wiki, more specifically [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Index) and the "Getting started" page.

- [Stardew Bot Framework](https://github.com/pandapanda135/stardew-bot-framework)
Most actions are made in the bot framework first then later used here.

- [CSharp Neuro SDK](https://github.com/pandapanda135/CSharp-Neuro-SDK)
This is used for Neuro SDK support.

- [Newtonsoft JSON](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/)
This is used for action schemas.

- [ModBuildConfig](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
This is used to make development easier.

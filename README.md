# Stardew Valley Neuro SDK Integration

A mod of Stardew Valley that allows for Neuro to play Stardew Valley.

## Limitations

- This is not completed yet and still needs more testing
- While most of the either necessary or often used menus work, not all menus have been tested.
- While parts of multiplayer may work, e.g. chatting and generally playing the game, it is not officially supported as of right now nor has been tested.

## Installation

- [SMAPI 4.3.2](https://smapi.io/)
To install SMAPI and this mod, I recommend following the steps presented on the [Stardew Valley wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started)
